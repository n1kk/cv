  inrto: "I am an ambitious developer with passion for web technologies, apps, games and pretty much everything that you can create by code. My path of experience over last ten years took me through different areas such as web development, design, applications and games, client-server interactions and many more. I am thorough in everything I develop and have a keen interest in user experience and design. I find myself to be a reasonable and competent person who accepts and encourages constructive criticism (we can't all be perfect). While having an occupation in such dynamic and fast evolving field I try to strive for continuous self improvement and education. There's a lot of new amazing stuff being created every day. I am a fast learner and am always looking forward to acquiring new skills and experience.",
  
  goals: "My interests include everything that is related to internet and computers. I am looking for projects that bring a challenge and allow me to utilize edge cutting tools and technologies. My preferences fall towards working environments that encourage self improvement and always try to keep up to date with current trends in web development world.",
  
  outro: "Currently I'm in a complicated love/hate relationship with JavaScript web dev, on one side there are so many things to help you develop amazing things fast, but on the other hand it's just overwhelming, there is endless sea of tools and frameworks that you cannot possibly learn them all, and new ones spring up like mushrooms every day. But still, I love web, I try to do everyting in web. Even this CV is made with web: [github.com/n1kk/cv](http://github.com/n1kk/cv)",
