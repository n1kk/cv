My path of experience over the last ten years has taken me through different areas such as web development, design, applications, games, client-server interactions and many more. I am thorough in everything that I develop, and have a keen interest in user experience and design.

While having an occupation in such a dynamic and fast evolving field I try to strive for continuous self improvement and education. I consider myself to be a fast learner and always eager to acquire new skills and experience.",

  outro: "Currently I'm in a complicated love/hate relationship with JavaScript web dev. On one side there's so many tools to help you develop amazing things fast, but on the other side the sheer amount is just overwhelming. There is an endless sea of libraries and frameworks that you cannot possibly learn them all, and new ones spring up like mushrooms every day. But still, I love JS, I try to do everything in JS.
